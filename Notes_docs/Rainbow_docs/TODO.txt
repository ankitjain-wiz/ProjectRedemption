a. Just find the integral part
b. Find the square root with an accuracy of n decimal points, n is provided by the user.

9. You are given S a sequence of n integers S = s 1 , s 2 , ..., s n . Please, compute if it is
possible to split S into two parts: s 1 , s 2 , ..., s i and s i+1 , s i+2 , ..., s n (1 <= i < n) in such a
way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.
First take n as input and then take n more integers, Output yes or no.
